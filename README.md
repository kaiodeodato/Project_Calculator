Project_Calculator kaio

To perform the first operation, click on a number, then click on the desired operation, 
then on another number and then on the equal key.

the following operations can use the previous result, just click on the next desired operation, 
after that on the next number and then on the equal key.

by design there is no 'multiply' key.

To clear the account history, click on the 'CLEAR' button

thanks
